If anyone read this, this is my FIRST project.
That mean dont be too harsh on the quality of my code.

My long term goal is the transform this git repo in a full on privacy and cryptocurrency base selling plateform (Ebay)

Any code reviews are more than welcome !
I primarly do this to improve my coding skill !

To do tommorrow :
